# Sign up for your Alexa Skill

Now that our skill and backend cloud infrastructure exists, we can now sign up to use the skill:

1. Install the Amazon Alexa app ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.dee.app&hl=en_US), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazon-alexa/id944011620?mt=8)) and sign in **using the same email address** that you used to create your Alexa skill. Alternatively, you may follow the [Alexa Beta Tester Guide](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/skills-beta-testing-for-alexa-skills.html) to invite others to use your skill.

2. Open the Alexa app and click **Devices** in the lower right:

3. Click **Your Smart Home Skills** in the middle of the screen:

4. You should see a skill named **alexa-smart-home-demo** (or, whatever name you used when creating your skill in the Alexa Developer Console). If you do not see your skill, ensure that you are signed in to the Alexa app using the same email you used in the Alexa Developer Console or using an email that you sent a beta invitation to. Click the skill name:
